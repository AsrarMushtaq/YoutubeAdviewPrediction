# YouubeAdviewPrediction
YouTube Adview Prediction is a simple ML Project based on regression problem. In this projeect, I've created an ml_model in which I try to predict number of Adviews for a youtube video based on the various feaures like number of likes,dislikes,clicks etc. I have used a dataset available online for training of my ML model.  
I've  used different regression based models in order redict my target Variable and evaluated the various metrics for accuracy. Out of varius models, DecisionTree performed the best.
I also compiled ANN Model. 
Finally , I trained my ANN model and used this model to predict my output Variable.
